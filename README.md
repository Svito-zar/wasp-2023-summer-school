# wasp-2023-summer-school

## Welcome

This repository hosts the full pipeline code for the WASP summer school 2023 group assignments. The system contains three major components, with corresponding resources broken down into the following folders:

- Generating text with a text prompt : [`./subsystem1_text-generation/`](https://github.com/Svito-zar/wasp-2023-summer-school/tree/main/subsystem1_text-generation)
- Synthesizing speech from text : [`./subsystem2_text-to-speech/`](https://github.com/Svito-zar/wasp-2023-summer-school/tree/main/subsystem2_text-to-speech)
- Generating gesture animations from audio : [`./subsystem3_gesture-generation/`](https://github.com/Svito-zar/wasp-2023-summer-school/tree/main/subsystem3_gesture-generation)

## Agenda
In the assignment you will be dealing with various systems. The primary goal is to first familiarize you with these systems, and then to use what you learned before making your final submissions.

The information below is derived from the original agenda [here](https://internal.wasp-sweden.org/event/wasp-summer-school-synthesis-of-human-communication-2023/). It will likely not be updated in case of any changes, but you will be notified on Slack (in the `general` channel for now).

- Monday 15:30 - Presentation of assignment
- Tuesday 14:00 - 15:00 - Work on [text generation tutorial](https://github.com/Svito-zar/wasp-2023-summer-school/tree/main/subsystem1_text-generation)
- Tuesday 15:00 - 16:00 - Work on [text to speech tutorial](https://github.com/Svito-zar/wasp-2023-summer-school/tree/main/subsystem2_text-to-speech)
- Wednesday 14:20 - 16:00 - Work on [gesture generation tutorial](https://github.com/Svito-zar/wasp-2023-summer-school/tree/main/subsystem3_gesture-generation)
- Wednesday 16:00 - 17:00 - Work on the tutorials / final assignment
- Thursday 09:00 - 12:00 - Work on final assignment
- **Thursday 12:00 - Submission deadline**
- Friday 09:00 - 12:00 - Demo of your submissions in the 3D dome



## Submission
Send an email to `tnikolov@hotmail.com` OR `tsakovm@gmail.com` with the following:
- Your team ID or team name
- A `.zip` of `.fbx` files
- A `.zip` of `.wav` files
- The scene you wish to use (Egypt, Village, or Island)

The `.fbx` and `.wav` files should be named in ascending order starting from 0 in the order they should be played back. Each file should also be prepended by a letter `a`, `b`, `c` or `d` that denotes the speaker. Each speaker corresponds to an *avatar*.

*TODO:* Add images of avatars that `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` can correspond to.

Example:
- Team #1
- Island
- fbx.zip
    - a0.fbx
    - b1.fbx
    - b2.fbx
    - c3.fbx
    - a4.fbx
    - d5.fbx
- wav.zip
    - a0.wav
    - b1.wav
    - b2.wav
    - c3.wav
    - a4.wav
    - d5.wav

We will take your files and put together a video clip similar to the one shown during the Monday presentation. The final composited video of all team submissions will be played in the Visualisation Center's 3D dome.
